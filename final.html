        <h3>Welcome to the World of Pythonmon! (Project Description)</h3>
    <p>
        Pokémon is the best selling video game franchise in the world and it has been going strong for 25 years! With this program, you can experience the unique battles of Pokémon 
        like never before in Python! This simulator will allow you to choose from 20+ Pokémon from the first 6 generations of the series to fight against an opponent! 
        To make things more spicy, the IVs, EVs, and nature of every Pokémon will be randomized at the start of each game!
    </p>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        After inputting "1" to play, you will be greeted into the world of Pythonmon and will have 
        the choice to choose one of 20 Pokémon. You will be greeted into Pythontown, where you can look 
        for enemy Pokémon to battle against by inputting "1", check your items and Pokédollars by inputting "2", 
        heal your Pokémon at the Pokécenter by inputting "3", purchase items with Pokédollars at the Pokémart by 
        inputting "4", or exiting the game by inputting "5". In battle, you can choose to input "1" and use 
        one of your Pokémon's four available moves, input "2" to use an item from your bag, or input "3" to run 
        away from the battle. We hope you enjoy Pythonmon!

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
          In Pythonmon, every game will be unique! The IVs, EVs, and nature of each Pokémon 
        will be completely random! In each battle, the player will fight against an opposing Pokémon with 
        one of their four moves. Each move has a type, power, accuracy, and some have distinct effects. The damage of a move depends on 
        its power and its accuracy is how likely the move will activate successfully. Like moves, each Pokémon 
        also has at least one type. A move can have its damage doubled, quadruple, halved, do only a quarter of 
        how much it would normally deal, or completely nullified depending on how effective its type is against 
        the opposing Pokémon's type(s). Some moves have special effects like inflicting a status on the opponent. 
        Every turn, the opposing Pokémon will use a random move out of the four in its moveset. 
        Whether or not you will be able to run away from your opponent will depend on if 
        you Pokémon is faster than the opponent or not. The speed stats of both Pokémon will be compared and 
        you can run away successfully if your Pokémon is faster. At the Pokécenter, the HP (health points) of 
        your Pokémon will be completely replenished to its max and any lingering status effects such as being 
        burned, poisoned, asleep, paralyzed, or frozen will be reset. At the Pokémart, you can use the Pokédollars 
        you've earned from battles to buy healing items to use on your Pokémon in battle. Hyper Potions heal 
        120 HP, Super Potions heal 60 HP, and Potions heal 20 HP.
